# Predicting Industrial Machine Downtime

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting industrial machine downtime using a dataset containing operational parameters and downtime records for three different machines. The goal is to minimize machine downtime to improve production efficiency and meet deadlines.

This project is structured into different difficulty levels, allowing for a progressive learning experience.

## Level 1: Data Exploration and Description

This first level focused on exploring and describing the dataset. It is designed for beginners to get familiar with the data.

### Challenge:

Create a report that covers the following:

*   What is the first and last date readings were taken on?
*   What is the average Torque?
*   Which assembly line has the highest readings of machine downtime?

*(Once completed, you would typically include a summary of your findings here or link to the relevant section in your notebook.)*

## Level 2: Data Visualization and Examination

This second level involves visualizing and examining the data in more detail to understand patterns and potential factors influencing machine downtime. This level is aimed towards intermediate learners.

### Challenge:

Create a report that covers the following:

*   Explore correlations between the various operational data in the dataset.
*   Do you see a pattern in machine downtime over time?
*   Which factors (visually) seem to be connected to machine downtime?

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Machine Downtime.csv`. It contains information about:

*   Operational parameters of industrial machines
*   Machine downtime records

### How to Run the Code

1.  **Open the Colab Notebook:** Open the Google Colab notebook associated with this project.
2.  **Mount Google Drive:** Run the cell to mount your Google Drive to access the dataset.
3.  **Load the Data:** Ensure the `file_path` variable in the notebook correctly points to the location of `Machine Downtime.csv` in your Google Drive and run the cell to load the data into a pandas DataFrame.
4.  **Install necessary libraries:** Run the initial cells to install `plotly` and `calplot` (and potentially `seaborn` and `matplotlib` if not already installed or if you prefer explicit installation).
5.  **Run the Analysis and Visualization Code:** Execute the code cells that perform the data exploration, correlation analysis, and plotting for both Level 1 and Level 2.
6.  **Generate the Report:** Use markdown cells in the Colab notebook to present your findings, including the visualizations, and answer the questions posed in the challenges.

### Project Structure

*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
*   `Your_Notebook_Name.ipynb`: The Google Colab notebook containing the code for data analysis and reporting.
*   `Machine Downtime.csv`: The dataset used in the project.

## Next Steps (for future levels)

Level 3 will likely involve predictive modeling and more advanced data science techniques.
